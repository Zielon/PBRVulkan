# Physically based renderer in Vulkan
####  Vulkan real-time path tracer
**[IN DEVELOPMENT]**\
Progressive real-time path tracer based on the extension `VK_KHR_ray_tracing`.

#### How to run:

Download [VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) and place it in `C:/VulkanSDK/x.x.x.x/`, next run `install.bat` script to download all necessary libraries. Additionally, for shaders compliation you will need `python` and `glslc` available form the shell level. `glslc` can be found for instance in `C:/VulkanSDK/x.x.x.x/Bin32/glslc.exe`.

C++17 is needed to compile the project.
